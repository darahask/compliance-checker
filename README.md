# Web-Crawler

A tool that generates an adherence report of a website based on parameters such as ADA compliance, Cookie Validity and SSL certificates.

We are proposing a tool, which would crawl the web and report the following measures:
- SSL certificate compliance
    - We will be using a library to identify the certificate and its expiry date along with that we will also be extracting all the URLs and verifying their SSL certificates as well.
- Cookie checker
    - We will be running scripts over web drivers to fetch all the cookies and compare them with your database to check their types and mention them in the report. For checking the cookie consent we will be parsing the web pages and looking for specific keywords present in the DOM. 
- ADA compliance
    - We will be selecting a few of the guidelines from the list of ADA compliances set up by W3 consortium based on our prime focus on user accessibility and ease of use. We will then be inspecting the tags of the HTML elements for getting the relevant information.
